# setup.sh — one-line bootstrapper: downloads this repo to a temp dir, then
# lets the zz_use it just downloaded install the core zz_* bundle from
# there (its own local-checkout install path, resolving a bin dir and
# linking every zz_* script onto it) and discards the temp dir.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomgrv/scripts/main/setup.sh | sh
#
# Pin to a specific tag, branch, or commit instead of main with a
# positional arg (curl ... | sh -s -- v2) or ZZ_ORIGIN_REF=v2. Bootstrap
# from a different org/repo entirely with ZZ_ORIGIN=someorg/otherscripts.
# Both are exported for the zz_use this script hands off to (and anything
# it execs), so every zz_use call afterwards defaults to this same origin
# — "wherever this install actually came from" — rather than a hardcoded
# tomgrv/scripts:
#
#   curl -fsSL .../setup.sh | sh -s -- v2
#
# Deliberately dumb and DRY: this script owns none of the bin-dir
# resolution or linking logic itself — that's zz_use's job, and
# duplicating it here would just be a second copy to keep in sync. Once
# the core zz_* scripts (zz_use foremost) are linked, every other script,
# core or functional, resolves and installs its own further dependencies
# on demand via zz_use — from a local cache (ZZ_CACHE_DIR, default
# ~/.cache/zz_scripts) when warm, or a fresh download into that cache
# otherwise. Run `zz_update` afterwards to force a fresh download,
# bypassing the cache.
#
# Deliberately POSIX /bin/sh, no dependency on anything in this repo
# beyond a shell and curl/tar to get the temp download in place.
